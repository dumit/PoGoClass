** Just approved! small seminar on Pokemon in Winter! Wed 4:40-6:30pm CRN: 25886 (2 units)

Hi there, I’m biomarx, you may have seen me on my blue bike during raid trains, a professor of Science & Technology Studies and Anthropology. I study how science, technology, media and medicine change. I’ve been studying and writing about gaming practices and for a while now. https://dumit.net/joe

Meanwhile, I’ve been wanting to teach a class on Pokemon and Pokemon Go. My lecture class in Winter had to be shifted to AI, but I added a last minute "first year seminar" 19 student class. The official title is “Roleplaying Games and Society” CRN: 25886 - more details to follow but if you have the time and inclination we will look at histories, internationalization, different play styles, monetization, community formation, and so on. These first-year seminars are supposed to be fun and supportive, creative and social, and this one ends with raid trains 🙂

message me if you have questions, but please circulate to your friends. The class is so last minute, it needs students! It can only have 19 though, so register if you are interested.
